## Description

The classic memory game format, the dealer shuffles the deck and deals 8 pairs of cards to you at random. You can then reveal a card by clicking on it, click on another to try and find it's mate. If you succeed, then you've got a pair! If not both cards are hidden from you again. A great test of your memory as you see if you can remember where each card is while you continue looking.

## Instructions

- A timer starts when you click on the first card.
- The quicker you find all 8 pairs the better your star rating.
- Press the circled arrow to restart the game at any time and get dealt a fresh deck of cards. Click 'Play Again' to do the same on completion.
